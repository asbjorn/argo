Argo
====

Argo is a [WebSocket](http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/) and
[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) [NMEA
2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_2000) server based on
[CANboat](https://github.com/canboat/canboat) and written in
[Go](http://golang.org). It is in the early stages of development and should be
considered a proof-of-concept at this point and not a mature product.
